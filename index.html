            <h2>The Student</h2>
            <p>I am a Junior at Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical
                University studying Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to study Computer Science because I wanted to be a game developer, but as I got older, I outgrew
                that dream and video games. Now, I study Computer Science because I believe that code can change the
                world. I want to use the skills I gain from Computer Science to solve educational, economical and social
                issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to think that I am an aspiring entrepreneur and philanthropist, but in reality, I have no clue
                what I want in life. We will see what God has planned.

            <h2>The Photographer</h2>
            <p>I was introduced to photography my Junior year of high school. On the track team, I had two roles;
                sprinter and photographer. One of my teammates loved my pictures so much that she asked me to take
                her
                senior portraits, which was suprising considering I shot on Automatic mode. Anywho, the rest is
                history.
            </p>
            <p>Today, I use the following equipment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fujifilm X100F</li>
                <li>Canon 5D Mark IV</li>

                <h3>How will I receive my photos?</h3>
                <p>After the shoot, you will receive a link to all the unedited images. Using the link, you
                    can download and choose which images you would like me to edit. Once your selected images
                    are edited, you will receive another link. All links expires after
                    2 weeks, so download and backup everything.
                </p>
                <h3>Booking your session.</h3>
                <p>In order to secure your date and time I require a 50% non-refundable deposit via Venmo or
                    Cash
                    App. Once the deposit has been paid, I will schedule a consultation date to properly prepare for
                    the shoot. There is also a $25 late fee for arriving to the shoot more than 15 minutes late.
                </p>
                <h3>What if I want to reschedule?</h3>
                <p>If the weather is bad or I am too sick to shoot, you can put your deposit toward a reschedule
                    or
                    have it refunded. If you need to cancel or
                    do not show up to the shoot, the deposit will not be refunded.</p>
