            <h2>The Student</h2>
            <p>I am a Junior at Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical
                University studying Computer Science and Spanish.
                I am also a member of Prairie View's Honors Program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to study Computer Science because I wanted to be a game developer, but as I got older, I outgrew
                that dream and video games. Now, I study Computer Science because I believe that code can change the
                world. I want to use the skills I gain from Computer Science to solve educational, economical and social
                issues. As for Spanish, I’ve always been fascinated by the language and culture. I was forced to take
                Spanish in 7th grade and I loved it. I loved it so much that I studied it all throughout high school up
                until the highest class offered - AP Spanish 5. Now, I’m minoring to continue the process I started in
                middle school and further stand out from everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to think that I am an aspiring entrepreneur and philanthropist, but in reality, I have no clue
                what I want in life. I also like to think that I am going to pursue my Ph.D. right after receiving my
                B.S. from Prairie View, but God may have something different planned.
            </p>
            <p>Stay tuned for updates.</p>

            <h2>The Photographer</h2>
            <p>I was introduced to photography my Junior year of high school. On the track team, I had two roles;
                sprinter and photographer. One of my teammates loved the pictures so much that she asked me to take
                her
                senior portraits, which was suprising considering I shot on Automatic mode. Anywho, the rest is
                history.
            </p>
            <p>Today, I use the following equipment:
                <ul>
                    <li>Canon 5D Mark II</li>
                    <li>Canon 5D Mark IV</li>
                    <li>Sigma ART 35mm 1.4</li>
                    <li>Sigma ART 50mm 1.4</li>
                    <li>Canon 85mm 1.2L lens</li>

                    <p>After the shoot, you will receive a link to all the unedited images. Using the link, you
                        can download and choose which images you would like me to edit. Once your selected images
                        are
                        edited, you
                        will receive another link. All links expires after 2 weeks, so download and backup
                        everything.

                    <p>In order to secure your date and time, I require a 50% non-refundable deposit via Venmo or
                        Cash
                        App. Once the deposit has been paid, I will schedule a consultation date to properly prepare for
                        the shoot. There is also a $25 late fee for arriving to the shoot more than 15 minutes late.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What if I want to reschedule?</h3>
                    <p>If the weather is bad or I am too sick to shoot, you can put your deposit toward a reschedule
                        or
                        have it refunded. If you need to cancel or
                        do not show up to the shoot, the deposit will not be refunded.</p>

                former because "Dev the Dev" sounds dope.
